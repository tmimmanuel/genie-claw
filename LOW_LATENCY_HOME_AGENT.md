# Low-Latency Private Home Agent Goal

This repository is moving toward one product goal:

GenieClaw should be the low-latency, limited-context, on-device AI harness for a
private household agent. Accuracy should come from the right home context, typed
memory, deterministic tools, and local device state, not from sending bigger
prompts to a bigger remote model.

## Product Target

The flagship target is GeniePod Home on Jetson-class hardware.

The agent should:

- answer quickly on local hardware
- stay useful inside a small context window
- preserve household privacy by default
- remember family and household facts as structured local memory
- control IoT devices through typed local interfaces
- degrade gracefully without the internet
- expose audit, confirmation, and memory-management surfaces to the household

Cloud or remote model providers are not the product default. OpenAI-compatible
API providers, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, custom providers, and similar adapters
exist only for better testing, development portability, and transitional
validation while the local runtime and harness mature.

## Context Strategy

The default Jetson contract remains 4096 tokens, but ordinary turns should use
less than that whenever possible.

The harness should prefer:

- compact system prompt
- short tool manifest
- top-k relevant memory facts
- current room/device state
- recent action state
- small response reserve
- deterministic fast paths for obvious utility requests

The harness should avoid:

- dumping raw conversation history
- injecting every memory
- carrying stale room/device facts
- using large remote context as a shortcut
- making the model infer state that a typed tool already knows

## Home Context Harness

The home context passed to the model should be curated and explicit.

Recommended shape:

```text
agent policy
family identity and speaker context
top relevant memories
current room or device graph slice
recent action summary
available tools and confirmation policy
user request
```

This keeps prompts small and makes answers more accurate. The model should see
only the context needed for the current turn.

## Family Memory

Household memory is a first-class local subsystem.

Memory should be:

- local by default
- structured with scope, sensitivity, and spoken policy
- editable and forgettable by the household
- retrieved by relevance, not dumped wholesale
- safe for shared-room voice responses
- independent of any particular LLM provider

The memory path should optimize for high-signal facts:

- names and family roles
- preferences
- recurring routines
- household device aliases
- safe durable facts
- recent actions that help explain what happened

Secrets, credentials, one-time codes, payment details, and hostile-user security
decisions do not belong in ordinary agent memory.

## Direct Local IoT Direction

The long-term home-control path should be direct, local, and AI-friendly.

GenieClaw should not become a wireless driver stack, but it should integrate
with a first-party local device graph and actuation boundary. The target split
is:

- `genie-os` owns radios, Linux interfaces, drivers, and service supervision.
- `genie-home-runtime` owns device graph, Matter/Thread/Zigbee/BLE adapters,
  automations, and final physical actuation safety.
- `genie-claw` owns user intent, memory, policy, confirmations, audit, and
  tool routing.

Home Assistant is useful today as a transitional provider. It should stay behind
a provider boundary so it can be replaced by the native home runtime without
rewriting prompt, memory, or channel code.

## Latency Rules

Low latency is a product requirement.

Prioritize:

- local `genie-ai-runtime`
- prompt-prefix reuse and stable prompt hashes
- short history windows
- fast deterministic routing before LLM calls
- hot local STT/TTS services when voice is enabled
- bounded read/request timeouts
- tool execution over model-only reasoning for known facts

Do not optimize by:

- raising context size by default
- enabling remote providers by default
- adding heavyweight retrieval to every request
- making voice or chat wait for optional services
- coupling core chat availability to wireless bring-up

## Provider Policy

Optional AI providers are transitional development and testing tools.

They are useful for:

- CI and contributor validation without Jetson hardware
- comparing tool-call behavior
- testing OAuth/API-key plumbing
- debugging context-budget and streaming behavior
- validating that the harness remains provider-agnostic

They are not:

- the default product path
- a replacement for local `genie-ai-runtime`
- a reason to increase default context
- a place to send household memory by default
- a way around local privacy and actuation policy

Any provider path must pass the same limited-context harness before it is used
for serious validation.

## Acceptance Direction

Future PRs should move the system toward:

- smaller active prompt inputs for common turns
- better memory selection instead of larger memory injection
- more deterministic home intent routing
- local device graph and wireless/IoT boundaries
- stronger audit and confirmation behavior
- better Jetson latency proof
- portable test harnesses that do not weaken the final on-device product

The long-term result should be a private, on-device, home-native agent that is
fast because it knows the household context, not because it depends on a remote
general-purpose assistant.
