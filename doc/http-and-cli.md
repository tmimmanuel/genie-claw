# HTTP And CLI Reference

## `genie-core` HTTP API

Served by `crates/genie-core/src/server.rs`.

Default bind:

- `127.0.0.1:3000`

Set `[core].bind_host = "0.0.0.0"` only when `genie-core` is behind a trusted
LAN, firewall, or first-party gateway. The API includes chat, memory, tool, and
physical-actuation surfaces, so localhost is the safe default.

### Request Limits And Hardening

Both `genie-core` (`:3000`) and `genie-api` (`:3080`) read inbound requests
through the shared, bounded reader in `genie-common::http`, configured by the
`[http]` section (see `deploy/config/geniepod.toml`). This protects the
always-on daemon from an unauthenticated peer on the LAN:

- An oversized request line or header is rejected with `431` (the request body
  is capped per server — 64 KiB for `genie-core`, 4 KiB for `genie-api` — and an
  over-cap `Content-Length` is rejected with `413`).
- A connection that opens and then stalls mid-request is dropped after
  `[http].read_timeout_secs`, so half-open connections cannot wedge the
  listener.
- Concurrent connections are capped at `[http].max_connections`; transient
  `accept()` errors (e.g. `EMFILE`) are logged and the accept loop continues
  rather than terminating the process.

### UI And Chat Endpoints

First-party clients should set `X-Genie-Origin` so tool and actuation policy can
differentiate `dashboard`, `api`, `voice`, `telegram`, and other surfaces.
Requests without the header are treated as `api`, not `dashboard`.

#### Trusted Origin Resolution (issue #232)

The origin drives per-origin tool ACLs, actuation ACLs, rate limits, audit
attribution, and NLU confidence thresholds, so the client-supplied
`X-Genie-Origin` header cannot be trusted on its own — otherwise any caller
could claim `voice` to clear a higher-trust bar or rotate origins to dodge a
per-origin rate limit. genie-core only honors an origin more privileged than the
`api` baseline when the request proves it is entitled to that origin:

- from a **loopback** peer — the documented single-host trust boundary (see
  [household-security.md](household-security.md)); or
- with an **`X-Genie-Origin-Token`** that matches the secret configured for the
  claimed origin under `[core.origin_auth]`.

Anything else — a privileged claim from a non-loopback peer with no valid token,
or a mismatched token — is downgraded to `api` and logged. This means a LAN peer
reaching a `bind_host = "0.0.0.0"` deployment **cannot** assume `voice`,
`dashboard`, or `telegram` from the header alone.

Configuration:

```toml
[core.origin_auth]
# Require a token even from loopback peers (hardens multi-process same-host
# setups). Off by default so the local dashboard, CLI, and in-process adapters
# work with no setup.
require_token = false
# origin -> shared secret presented in the X-Genie-Origin-Token header.
# Prefer the GENIE_ORIGIN_TOKEN_<ORIGIN> env var and keep config files 0600.
tokens = { dashboard = "", telegram = "" }
```

Each origin's token may instead be supplied via the
`GENIE_ORIGIN_TOKEN_<ORIGIN>` environment variable (e.g.
`GENIE_ORIGIN_TOKEN_TELEGRAM`). The in-process Telegram adapter automatically
presents its configured token, so its `telegram` principal stays unforgeable by
other local processes and keeps working when `require_token = true`.

## Core Response Shapes

### `POST /api/chat`

Request:

```json
{"message":"what time is it?"}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "response": "...",
  "tool": "get_time",
  "conversation_id": "..."
}
```

`tool` is omitted or `null` when no tool was used.

### `POST /api/chat/stream`

Streaming events are newline-delimited JSON.

Current event types:

- `token`: normal streamed text
- `replace`: replace prior text with final tool-backed response
- `done`: final event with `response`, optional `tool`, and `conversation_id`

### `GET /api/health`

Current top-level fields:

- `status`
- `llm`
- `memories`
- `conversations`
- `mem_available_mb`
- `connectivity`
- `web_search`
- `runtime_contract`
- `version`

`runtime_contract` is a compact summary with the active contract hash, prompt
hash, tool schema hash, policy hash, hydration hash, model family, and tool
count. Use `GET /api/runtime/contract` for the full payload.

### `GET /api/runtime/contract`

Operational fingerprint for deterministic startup and incident response.

Current top-level fields:

- `schema_version`
- `package`
- `version`
- `model_family`
- `max_history_turns`
- `prompt_hash`
- `tool_schema_hash`
- `policy_hash`
- `hydration_hash`
- `contract_hash`
- `tool_names`
- `policy`
- `hydration`
- `validation`

Use this endpoint to verify that a deployed box booted with the expected
prompt, tool surface, policy settings, and hydrated local state.

If `[core].expected_runtime_contract_hash` is configured, `validation.status`
is `ok` or `drift`. Without a pinned hash, the status is `unpinned`.

At daemon startup, `genie-core` also appends the full contract to:

```text
<data_dir>/runtime/contracts.jsonl
```

This file is intended for support bundles and incident reconstruction.

### `POST /api/web-search`

Request:

```json
{"query":"ESP32-C6 Thread support","limit":3,"fresh":false}
```

Current response shape:

```json
{
  "tool": "web_search",
  "success": true,
  "query": "ESP32-C6 Thread support",
  "provider": "duckduckgo",
  "fresh": false,
  "cached": false,
  "blocked": false,
  "result_count": 3,
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Example",
      "text": "Example result text",
      "url": "https://example.test"
    }
  ],
  "response": "Web search results for ..."
}
```

If a query is blocked as sensitive, the endpoint still returns `200` with
`blocked: true` and `result_count: 0`.

### `GET /api/actuation/pending`

Current response shape:

```json
{
  "pending": [
    {
      "token": "act-...",
      "entity": "front door",
      "action": "unlock",
      "value": null,
      "reason": "Front door is not marked voice-safe",
      "requested_by": "voice",
      "created_ms": 1777000000000,
      "expires_ms": 1777000600000
    }
  ],
  "audit_log": {
    "enabled": true,
    "storage": "local_private_file"
  }
}
```

### `GET /api/actuation/actions`

Returns the short recent action ledger used for explanations and bounded undo.
The ledger is restored from the append-only actuation audit log when
`genie-core` starts.

Current response shape:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "entity": "living room lights",
      "action": "turn_on",
      "value": null,
      "inverse_action": "turn_off",
      "origin": "voice",
      "summary": "Turned on living room lights.",
      "confidence": 0.94,
      "executed_ms": 1777000000000
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/actuation/confirm`

Request:

```json
{"token":"act-..."}
```

Response:

```json
{"ok":true,"response":"Done."}
```

The confirmation endpoint is intended for local trusted surfaces.

### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Supported request shape:

- OpenAI-style `messages`
- optional `model`
- optional `max_tokens`

Current implementation returns one assistant message in the `choices` array.
Token accounting fields are present but currently zero-filled.

## `genie-ctl` CLI

Implemented in `crates/genie-ctl/src/main.rs`.

### Main Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `genie-ctl status` | System status summary |
| `genie-ctl mode <MODE>` | Change governor mode |
| `genie-ctl chat <MESSAGE>` | Send one chat request |
| `genie-ctl search [--fresh] [--limit N] <QUERY>` | Direct web search |
| `genie-ctl history` | Show current conversation history |
| `genie-ctl tools` | List available tools |
| `genie-ctl connectivity` | Show coprocessor boundary status |
| `genie-ctl skill ...` | Manage loadable skills |
| `genie-ctl speaker ...` | Manage local speaker identity profiles |
| `genie-ctl health` | Service health report |
| `genie-ctl conversations` | List stored conversations |
| `genie-ctl update-check` | OTA check |
| `genie-ctl diag` | Diagnostics summary |
| `genie-ctl support-bundle [PATH]` | Write a JSON diagnostics bundle |
| `genie-ctl version` | Version output |

### `genie-ctl support-bundle`

Writes a local JSON support bundle. If no path is provided, the output goes to:

```text
/tmp/geniepod-support-<timestamp>.json
```

The bundle includes service reachability, governor status, core health, runtime
contract, connectivity status, redacted household security posture, actuation
state, selected system files, binary inventory, model inventory, recent runtime
contracts, recent tool audit events, and recent actuation audit events. It
records config presence but does not copy config contents.

### Skill Subcommands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `genie-ctl skill list` | List installed runtime skills |
| `genie-ctl skill install <SOURCE.so> [DEST_NAME]` | Validate and install a skill |
| `genie-ctl skill remove <SKILL_NAME|FILE_NAME>` | Remove a skill |
| `genie-ctl skill dir` | Print runtime skill directory |

`genie-ctl skill list` also reports optional sidecar manifest status. A skill
`hello.so` may include `hello.skill.json`; the CLI shows manifest status,
requested permissions, capabilities, review identity, and whether signature
material is present. This is audit visibility only in the current release.

### Speaker Subcommands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `genie-ctl speaker list [--profile-dir DIR]` | List enrolled local speaker profiles |
| `genie-ctl speaker enroll <NAME> <WAV> [--profile-dir DIR]` | Enroll a WAV sample as a local speaker profile |
| `genie-ctl speaker enroll-live <NAME> [--device DEV] [--sample-rate N] [--duration SECS] [--profile-dir DIR]` | Record and enroll a speaker profile in one step |
| `genie-ctl speaker record <OUT.wav> [--device DEV] [--sample-rate N] [--duration SECS]` | Record a reusable enrollment/test WAV |
| `genie-ctl speaker identify <WAV> [--profile-dir DIR] [--min-score N]` | Match a WAV sample against enrolled profiles |
| `genie-ctl speaker remove <NAME> [--profile-dir DIR]` | Delete an enrolled speaker profile |

Speaker profiles store compact local acoustic fingerprints, not raw audio. They
are used for household memory routing in voice mode and are not a hostile-user
authentication boundary.

## Current Built-In Tool Families

The exact tool list depends on config and loaded skills, but the built-in
surface currently includes:

- home control, home status, home undo, and action history
- time
- weather
- web search
- system info
- calculator
- media playback trigger
- memory recall, status, forget, and store
- timers
- explicit scene/routine activation phrases such as "goodnight GenieClaw"

Home-control execution now has three separate safety layers:

- prompt and tool guidance for model behavior
- first-pass local action policy
- final runtime actuation gate plus append-only audit logging
- recent action ledger for "what did you do?" and bounded undo
- tool audit events include an `action_class` such as `read_only`,
  `memory_write`, `home_actuation`, `network`, `media`, or `diagnostic`

Memory tools are policy-aware:

- memory recall defaults to shared-room-safe disclosure
- safe relationship memories maintain a local household-profile index for exact
  role recall before FTS fallback
- safe device-alias memories maintain a local alias index for exact
  Home Assistant target resolution before fuzzy matching
- safe profile attributes and household rules maintain local indexes for exact
  age, preference, allergy, homework, and screen-time recall
- safe notes, reminders, manuals, and watch notes maintain a typed local FTS
  index for direct questions such as "find my note about..." or "where are..."
- password/code questions can resolve to app-only secret references without
  exposing the value in shared-room chat
- selected safe preferences, notes, shopping, media, and manual memories also
  maintain local embeddings for fuzzy household recall such as comfort,
  lunchbox, and movie questions when exact words are missing
- person/private/restricted memories may be withheld unless stronger read context is supplied
- memory status reports canonical artifact counts plus policy-scope counts
