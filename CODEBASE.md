# GenieClaw Codebase Guide

This document is the file-level companion to `README.md`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Use it when you need to answer questions like:

- Where does a user chat turn enter the system?
- Which file owns Home Assistant resolution versus tool routing?
- Which crate is responsible for service health, mode switching, or deploy setup?
- If I need to change a behavior, where should I start reading?

It is intentionally practical. It describes what each major file owns today so the codebase is easier to navigate and extend.

## How To Read This Repo

The repository is organized around a small Rust workspace plus deployment assets:

- `crates/`
  Core binaries and libraries.
- `deploy/`
  Jetson setup, config templates, helper scripts, and systemd units.
- `skills/`
  Native loadable skill example plus authoring docs.
- top-level markdown files
  Product overview, getting started, roadmap, and architecture notes.

At runtime, the system is split across several processes:

1. `genie-core`
   The user-facing local AI runtime.
2. `genie-governor`
   The service and memory pressure controller.
3. `genie-health`
   The local service monitor.
4. `genie-api`
   The lightweight system dashboard API.
5. `genie-ctl`
   The CLI used by developers and operators.

## Runtime Flow

The most important runtime path is:

1. A request enters through the web UI, CLI, REPL, voice loop, or Telegram adapter.
2. `genie-core` builds prompt context from conversation history and household memory.
3. The LLM facade talks to the configured OpenAI-compatible backend. Jetson
   deploys default to local `genie-ai-runtime`; development configs can still
   use a local `llama.cpp` server. Remote/API providers are transitional
   testing adapters only.
4. If the model emits a tool call, the tool parser and dispatcher execute the tool.
5. Tool results may be returned directly or summarized, depending on the tool.
6. Conversation state and extracted memory are persisted to SQLite.

Around that path:

- `genie-governor` manages modes, memory pressure, and service lifecycle.
- `genie-health` polls local service endpoints and logs failures.
- `genie-api` exposes dashboard-friendly system endpoints.

  `crates/genie-core/src/prompt.rs`
- Think/no-think or model routing:
  `crates/genie-core/src/reasoning.rs`
- Tool registration and execution:
  `crates/genie-core/src/tools/dispatch.rs`
- Home Assistant resolution or health behavior:
  `crates/genie-core/src/ha/provider.rs`
- Home Assistant action/status tool behavior:
  `crates/genie-core/src/tools/home.rs`
- System status answers:
  `crates/genie-core/src/tools/system.rs`

- Deploy behavior on Jetson:
  `deploy/setup-jetson.sh`
  `deploy/systemd/`
  `deploy/config/`

## Notes On Maintenance

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` should explain the system shape.
- `CODEBASE.md` should explain where code lives and what owns what.
- `README.md` should stay product- and repo-oriented.
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` should stay operator-focused.

If you add a new crate, service, adapter, or major subsystem, update this document in the same change so the map stays current.
